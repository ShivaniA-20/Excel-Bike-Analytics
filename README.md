# Excel-Bike-Analytics

## Project Overview  
This project leverages Excel to analyze bike purchasing trends and generate actionable insights. Using a dummy dataset, the analysis explored various dimensions such as income, commute patterns, and age demographics of customers. The results provided a comprehensive understanding of customer behaviors and preferences.

## Dataset  
The dataset includes the following columns:  

* Customer ID
* Gender
* Income
* Distance from Store (miles)
* Age
* Bike Purchased


## Key Analyses  
### 1. Income Analysis  
**Objective:** To determine the average income of customers who purchased or did not purchase bikes.  

 * **Approach:** Created a Pivot Chart with **Income** and **Gender** on the axes to calculate the average income per purchase.
   
* **Insights:**  
  * Females who purchased bikes had an average income of **$55,774**, while non-buyers had an average income of **$53,440**.  
  * Similar patterns were observed among males.

 
### 2. Commute Distance Analysis 
**Objective:** To understand how commute distance affects bike purchases.

  * **Approach:** Developed a Pivot Chart with Distance from Store (miles) on the X-axis and the count of bikes purchased on the Y-axis.  
  * **Insights:** Identified commuting ranges most associated with bike purchases, highlighting proximity as a key factor.

### 3. Age Demographics Analysis  
**Objective:** To identify the age group most likely to purchase bikes.

 * **Approach:**  Grouped customers into Adolescents (under 31), Middle-Aged (31-54), and Older Adults (55+), and created a Pivot Chart to compare bike purchases across these groups.  
 * **Insights:**
     * The majority of purchases (383) were made by Middle-Aged customers (31-54).
     * Adolescents were the least active group, with only 39 purchases.

  
## Key Excel Features Used
* **Pivot Tables and Charts** for dynamic data visualization and summarization.
* **Data Grouping** to classify customers by age brackets.
* **Conditional Formatting** to highlight key trends.
* **Calculated Fields** to derive insights such as average income per purchase.


## Outcomes
The analysis provided actionable insights into customer behavior:

* **Income trends** across buyers and non-buyers.
* **Distance threshold**s critical for marketing and targeting.
* **Age demographics** most likely to purchase bikes, aiding in focused marketing strategies.
