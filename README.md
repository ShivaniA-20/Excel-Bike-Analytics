# Excel-Bike-Analytics

# Introduction
This is a dataset which contains details of customers and whether they have purchased a bike or not depending on their income and age.

# Report
 __1.__ __Average__ __Income__ __Per__ __Purchase__

This is an excel dashboard utilizing Pivot Charts to analyze purchasing patterns based on gender and income. The primary focus was calculating the Average Income Per Purchase to identify trends among buyers and non-buyers of bikes. For instance, the analysis revealed that the average income of females who purchased bikes was $55,774, while those who did not purchase bikes had an average income of $53,440. Similar income trends were observed for males, providing actionable insights into customer behavior.


__2.__ __Customer Commute__

   Pivot Chart to analyze customer commuting patterns and their impact on bike purchases. The chart plotted the distance from the store (miles) on the X-axis and the number of bikes purchased on the Y-axis. This visualization helped identify the commuting ranges of customers who purchased bikes, providing valuable insights into target customer proximity and purchasing behavior.

   
__3.__ __Customer__ __Age__ __Bracket__  

I designed a Pivot Chart to analyze bike purchases across different age brackets: Adolescents (under 31), Middle-Aged (31-54), and Older Adults (55+). The analysis highlighted that the majority of purchases were made by Middle-Aged individuals, with 383 buyers in this group. In contrast, Adolescents accounted for the least purchases, with only 39 buyers and 71 non-buyers. This project provided clear insights into the age demographics of bike purchasers.
